# Sudoku Solver Flask Frontend
## Set Up
First one needs a compiled version of the sudoku solver available [here](https://github.com/spr332/CS4613-Project-2-SP19-SPR332 "here"). You'll need to compile it for your system for this to work.
The compiled file name should replace the `<compiled solver name>` in the os.system() call in the app.py file.
The compiled file should be in the same directory as the app.py file.
Second you'll need flask for Python 3, `pip3 install flask'
## Usage
Once the code is set up, one may simply run using `python app.py` and connecting to localhost in the browser.
